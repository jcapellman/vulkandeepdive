# Vulkan API Deep Dive

Much like my deep dive into Redis/NodeJS (https://github.com/jcapellman/DaysInNode) about a year ago I wanted to dive into Vulkan.  The idea being I will chroncile each evening I dedicate to Vulkan with a new example and associated blog post. YouTube videos will also coincide with the posts.
